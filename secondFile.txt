Welcome to our fortress tall
I'll take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For you see the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much.

The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense
Foreign life forms inventory
Suspended State of cryogenics
